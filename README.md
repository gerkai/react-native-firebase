# React Native Firebase

This is a React Native Firebase Starter Project with login, registration, persisted login, database reads and writes. You can use this project as boilerplate for bootstrapping any new React Native app that uses Firebase as its backend.

## Getting Started (with Expo)

If you are using Expo Cli, clone the repo and run "expo start" in the root folder of the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/instamobile/react-native-firebase.git
cd react-native-firebase
expo start
```

## Getting Started (without Expo)

If you prefer using React Native CLI, you'll need to eject from Expo first:

```
git clone https://github.com/instamobile/react-native-firebase.git
cd react-native-firebase
expo eject
npm install
react-native run-android // react-native run-ios
```
